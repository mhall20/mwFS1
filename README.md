The mwFS1 is what I chose to create for my senior research project. It is an all button arcade stick designed to play fighting games like Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat on PC.

This project included PCB creation, Arduino coding, and 3D printing; all of which I had to research for a long time because I was very unfamiliar with these topics.
